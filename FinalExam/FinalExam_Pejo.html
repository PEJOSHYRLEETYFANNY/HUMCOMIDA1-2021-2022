                    Boracay Island, one of the top beaches in the Philippines and one of the best Visayas tourist spots,
                    is blessed w ith a long stretch of powdery white sand beach (Called White Beach),
                    crystal clear and azure waters, a stunning sunset, and more. 
                    the island doesn’t fall short onn adventures and activities for people of all ages. 
                    The name Boracay is attributed to different origins. 
                    One story says that it is derived from the local word "borac" which means white cotton with characteristics 
                    close to the color and texture of Boracay's white sugary and powdery sand. “Calm, warm waters, gently sloping sand, 
                    very relaxing, possibly the most beautiful beach in Asia”. This was how TripAdvisor described Boracay Island 
                    after it published their annual pick of the best beaches. Voted by the travelers themselves, 
                    Boracay ranked top 24 all over the world and the top 2 in Asia</p>

                        Siargao is an island of nine municipalities in the province of Surigao del Norte. 
                        Known as the “Surfing Capital of the Philippines”,
                        Siargao is mainly responsible for introducing surfing to the country. Apart from surfing, 
                        Siargao is also open to other activities such as cave explorations and rock climbing.
                        One of the best-known surfing spots in Siargao is Cloud 9, to which the town owes its surfing legacy.
                        Cloud 9 is world-famous for its thick, hollow tubes and fast-barreling right-hand waves that break over a reef.
                        Siargao is a smaller island (169 sq miles) in the province of Surigao del Norte.
                        The name of the island comes from the Visayan Language (A Central Filipino Dialect) 
                        for the specific type of mangrove found all over the islands, Siargaw (Premna Odorata). 
                        Surigao City is popularly known as the City of Island Adventures and is considered a haven of leisure and adventure because 
                        it has 17 panoramic islands with long stretches of pristine white sand beaches, mystical caves, 
                        vast mangrove forest and under water sceneries.</p>

                            Pagudpud is a northern coastal town located in the Ilocos Norte region of the Philippines. 
                            It is located 77 KM north of Laoag City in Ilocos Norte. 
                            It's a must-visit destination in Northern Luzon and is usually part of the Ilocos itinerary as a side trip when in Laoag.
                            It is often referred to as the “Boracay of the North” mainly because of its stunning white Pagudpud Ilocos beaches, 
                            which is what Pagudpud is known for. One of the beautiful small towns in the Philippines,
                            Pagudpid is not packed with fancy shops, bars, and clubs. However, it offers visitors wonderful natural attractions like coves, 
                            caves, and rock formations and is an emerging top tourist destination in the Philippines and a must-visit Luzon tourist spot. 
                            You may not party the night away in Pagudpud like Boracay, but you can enjoy the outdoors and the beauty of nature. </p>

                            Baguio, to many, is best known as the "Summer Capital of the Philippines", 
                            with its cool climate making this a spot to escape the chaotic scenes in Manila. 
                            The city is also home to tropical pine forests, lending the city the nickname "City of Pines". 
                            It serves as a tourist hub in the Cordilleras, serving as a jumping point to other tourist spots like Mount Pulag, 
                            Sagada and Banaue. Baguio is considered a city separate from the province of Benguet,
                            but it is considered part of Benguet practically, and it is the economic center for both the province and the Cordillera region. 
                            Some of the city's tourism promotions also point to nearby La Trinidad, which is both administratively and geographically in Benguet,
                            and is the provincial capital.</p>

                            but the island also offers limestone karst landscapes, beautiful beaches, 
                            crystal-clear freshwater lakes, and shallow-water coral reefs
                            It's nicknamed as The Blue Lagoon and surrounded by tall limestone formations, 
                            making the area look and feel very secluded. Either enjoy the view or take a dip, 
                            the choice is up to you! If you want to see underwater artifacts from the 40s, 
                            you'll enjoy wreck diving in the waters of Coron.
                            Coron was created as a municipality by the American authorities in 1902. 
                            Two years later, the island Culion was removed from the jurisdiction of Coron. 
                            In 1950, several barrios were separated to form the municipality of Busuanga. Later, 
                            the Linapacan group of islands became an independent municipality.</p>

                            Cebu City is the capital city of the province of Cebu and is the “second city” of the Philippines,
                            being the center of Metro Cebu, the second most populous Metropolitan area in the Philippines after Metro Manila.
                            For six years, until Legazpi's removal to Manila, Cebu was the Spanish colonial capital. 
                            It remained the primary Spanish bastion in the southern part of the Philippines.
                            The cultural and commercial core of the central Visayan region, Cebu was opened to foreign trade in 1860. 
                            It was chartered as a city in 1936.
                            The furniture industry of Cebu Province is gaining much recognition around the world for its excellent designs and high standard quality products. 
                            Aside from the world-class artistic designs and quality, Cebu's furniture gives you the most comfortable and homely feeling.
                            It has countless coves and beaches, but it is the tiny islands just offshore that will capture your heart. Boasting sugar-white beaches,
                             clear azure waters and astounding coral reefs just offshore, they are holiday-brochure perfect, but without the crowds.</p>

                            This place is known as Mestizo District, 
                            where the streets are lined with Spanish Era ancestral houses
                            (all with Spanish time tile roofs, massive hardwood flooring,
                            balustrades and other in varying Spanish, Mexican, and Chinese architectural styles). 
                            Vigan is famous for its well-preserved Spanish Colonial town, historical Vigan tourist spots,
                            and delicious food and delicacies. Because of its charm, it has been inscribed as one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 
                            Conquistador Juan de Salcedo attacked and secured the town, giving it the name Vigan after a native plant. 
                            He expanded the name to Villa Fernandina in honor of the Philip II's deceased son. 
                            Salcedo continued his conquest, attacking and subjugating Camarines, Albay, and Catanduanes.
                            Vigan is unique for having preserved much of its Hispanic colonial character, particularly its grid street pattern and historic urban lay out.
                            Its significance also lies on how the different architectural influences are blended to create a homogenous townscape.</p>
